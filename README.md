**Project Overview.**
  
The aviation industry is one of the fastet growing industries in the world. Air being the fastest mode of transport, has led to an increase in travellers and transportation of goods areound the globe. It however, faces a challenge on having very scarce accidents but still very severe. This leaves a gap, where one can invest in less risky aircrafts as an entry into the aviation industry. I use data from AviationData.csv to try and find the least risky aircrafts to invest in.
Business understanding

Th e aviation industry has been one of the fastest growing industries in the world. IT, however, faces challenges on the severity of accidents proving serious more often. There are however factors to consider while choosing the make and model of aircrafts to invest in based on the number of accidents and the severity of accidents. I try to utilize the data from AviationData.csv to break down the preferd aircrafts to invest in
## Project Goal

My project targets to know the make and model of aircrafts that can be used either in businesses or commercially and have a low risk of accidents. The frequency and severity of accidents from a particular make and model will shape the risk meter of the aircraft
### Data Understanding

Information from the dataset was fetched from kaggle where a research and analysis was dome by different scientists and is in  acsv formart. The data has 88889 rows and 31 columns. It contains both categorical data and most of the data is numerical.
